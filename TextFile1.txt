TL:DR It's not good to have to change the IP address every time the server changes. Make a central location(class) to 
manage the SQL from as well as a config file. 

Detail Explanation: I am starting work on a SQL class that we can use throughout the program. Ideally, this would mean that
we could call functions and variable instead of having to re-initialize them every time we make a new form. 

Value Gained: 
	-heavily increased modularity
	-increased reliability/stability

Class Name:  TigerSQL 
Description: Call sql commands and connections from central location
