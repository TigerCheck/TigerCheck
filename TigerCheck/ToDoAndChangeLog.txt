ToDo:	Add submit button on newSessionScreen
		Disable/hide buttons until new session created
		Verify age, on CheckInScreen, is an int and not a float/double
nonissue	Make sure barcodes are 4 digits long, add preceding zeroes if necessary (I forgot ints don't hold leading 0s regardless)

		Handle checking out if nobody is checked in.
